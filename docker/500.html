<h1>Oooops!</h1>

<p>We've encountered a 500 Internal Server Error.</p>

<p>However, not all hope is lost. There is a known issue related to authentication which may be caused this error to occur. Typically, we see this problem arise users of Mac OS X using Safari.</p>

<p>If you have come to this page as a result of authenticating, you might find that you can authenticate successfully by <a href='https://www.captain-teach.org/auth/'>clicking here</a>. For most users, this resolves the problem.

<p>If you've tried to authenticate by following the link above and you're still arriving on this page, something else we did not expect has occurred. Please report this error to jcollard@cs.umass.edu. In your email, please provide  the URL which you were trying to access, the account you're trying to authenticate with, the version and browser you are using, and the operating system you are currently using. This information will help us fix any future issues.

<p>Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
